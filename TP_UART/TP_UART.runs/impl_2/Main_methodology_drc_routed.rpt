TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.336 ns between int_tx/aux_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/salida_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.822 ns between int_tx/aux_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/salida_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.237 ns between int_tx/aux_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/salida_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
